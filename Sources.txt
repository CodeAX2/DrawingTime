Ideas of where to go:

- Start with fourier series, introducing drawing images using circles
- Then talk about audio
    - Audio is a combination of various frequencies, but how do we extract the frequencies?
- Fourier transform!
- Outputs a function f : frequency -> magnitude
- Must be done over an interval, so "real-time" is usually the last few milliseconds
- So, audio has 3 variables: time, magnitude, and frequency, but our functions only represent 2 at a time...
- Introduct SPECTROGRAM!
- Similar to real time, break time into time frames, around 20-30ms, but we want some overlap
    - So make time frames 20ms, but start them every 10ms
